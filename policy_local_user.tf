## Local User Policies
##
## This policy is more complex in the Intersight API than it appears in the GUI.
## As a result, this object looks a bit more complex in TF that you might expect.
##
## The real goal of the first part of this policy is simply to set the password of the
## built-in admin user.  The additional of a secondary user just extends the concepts.

# This is the base policy, which does not include any users
